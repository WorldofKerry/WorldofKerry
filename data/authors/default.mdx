Welcome to my website. I'm Kerry Wang, a 3rd year computer engineering student at the University of British Columbia.
I'm interested in computer vision, big data, logistics, infastructure, and robotics.
When I'm bored, I enjoy learning about history, politics, entrepreneurship, economics, and more.
In my free time I like to workout, bike, play video games, learn the guitar, think, and browse Reddit.
Three words to describe myself are: efficient, independent, and resourceful ... what would you <a href="https://mainserver.worldofkerry.repl.co/upload/website" target="_blank">say</a>?
