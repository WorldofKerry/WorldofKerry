## Weak Induction

### Base Case

Prove the statement holds for $n=0$.

### Inductive Step

Prove that if the statement holds for any given case $n=k$, then it must also hold for the next case $n=k+1$.

## Strong Induction

Given a statement $P(x)$.

### Inductive Step

Prove $P(m+1)$ assuming that $P(n)$ holds for all [[Natural Number]]s $n$ less than $m+1$.
