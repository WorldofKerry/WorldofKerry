## Definition

Makes a choice based on a simple, local criterion. Then solve subproblems that result from that choice. Combine the choice and the subproblem solution
[[Greedy Algorithm Proof]]

## Examples of Choice

- Interval with earliest finishing time
- Job with earliest deadline
- Item needed furthest in the future
- Smallest weight edge that does not create a cycle

## Types of Problems

Optimization with Ordering: choice based on (weighted) sorting, with proof exchange argument
Intervals: choice based on (weighted) sorting, with proof by "stays ahead"
Graphs: choice based on weights, edges, verticies, with proof by contradiction

## Sample Problems

[[Greedy Graph Colouring]]
[[Min Interval Subset that Overlaps with All Intervals]]
[[Optimal Scheduling]]
