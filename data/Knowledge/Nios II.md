A 32-bit CPU that can be implemented in an Intel FPGA device. Two versions of the Nios II processor are available, designated economy (/e) and fast (/f).
To run an assembly/C program on the Nios II, [[Intel FPGA Monitor Program]] -> [New/Open Project] -> Actions -> Compile & Load. May need to install Cygwin64 with Bash, and move it to the `./bin` folder of [[Intel Quartus Prime Software]].
To create a Nios II system, [[Intel Quartus Prime Software]] -> [Create/Open Project] -> Tools -> Platform Designer. Export the system to run using [[Intel FPGA Monitor Program]].
