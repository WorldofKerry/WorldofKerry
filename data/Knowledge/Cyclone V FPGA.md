A [[Field-programmable Gate-Arrays (FPGA)]] unit with two [[Nios II]] processors, and several peripheral ports: memory, timer modules, audio-in/out, video-in/out, PS/2, analog-to-digital, infrared receive/transmit, and parallel ports connected to switches and lights.
To generate RTL, use [[Intel Quartus Prime Software]] -> [Create/Open Project] -> Processing -> Start Compilation. The RTL netlist can be viewed by [[Intel Quartus Prime Software]] -> [Create/Open Project] -> Netlist Viewers -> RTL Viewer.
To program the FPGA using generated RTL, use [[Intel Quartus Prime Software]] -> Tools -> Programmer.
