Manipulation of images, using using matrix [[Convolution]]s and [[Correlation]]s.

## Linear Filters

### 2D Box Filter

A Square
Seperable

### 2D Pillbox Filter

A circle
Rotationally invariant

### Gaussian Filter

A 2d gaussian distribution
Seperable and rotationally invariant

### Low Pass Filters

Filters out all of the high frequency content of the image, only low frequencies remain

### High Pass FIlters

Filters out all of the low frequency content of the image, only high frequencies remain

## Non-Linear Filters

### Median Filter

Takes the [[Median]] value in a kernel

### Bilateral Filter

A filter that both smoothes and retains edges
