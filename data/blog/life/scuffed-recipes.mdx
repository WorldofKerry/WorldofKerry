# Scuffed Recipes

A collection of "recipes" I have made up over the years. \
My definition of edibility requires at least two of the three criteria to be met:

1. Cheap
2. Tasty
3. Healthy

## Contents

[Instant Latte](#instant-latte)

## Instant Latte <a name="instant-latte"></a>

Inside of a 20oz blender bottle, add:

- half a tablespoon of instant coffee
- a tablesppon of skim milk powder (I prefer skim milk as less fat $\implies$ easier to clean bottle)

Fill with cold tap water. Shake vigorously. Drink. \
Cheap, kinda tasty, no real health benefits.
