# Quick Flatbread

Put (avocado) oil in a (cast iron) pan. Preheat to medium-high heat.

In a regular bowl mix together:

- white flour
- water
  Until it's a mostly homogeneous. You want viscosity similar to that of pancake batter.

Dump the mixture into the pan. Add salt at some point.

Flip when the bottom is browned.

Add whatever you want as toppings.

Topping ideas:

- Mixed leafy greens
- Cheese
- Peanut butter
