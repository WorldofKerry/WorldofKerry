# Summary

Implemented a 16-bit RISC computer, using custom assembly and machine code. Can read instructions/data to/from memory, and perform basic computations.

## Key Takeaways

- Modular Design
- I/O interface

<br></br># Project Components ## Implemented Modules - Arithmetic-Logic Unit (ALU) - Datapath (Uses
the 'registers' and ALU to logic) - CPU (Interface for datapath, state machine, memory, and I/O) -
Shifter (Shifts data by a given amount) - Register File (Emulates registers in a CPU) - State
Machine (Controls instruction decode and datapath) - Instruction Decoder (Decodes instructions)

HDL code can be provided upon request, due to course policies.

## Simulation

- Full testbenchs for all modules using ModelSim Altera

## Compilation
